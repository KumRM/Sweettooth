# Sweettooth
My E-Commerce Project on Cakes And Confectioneries.

Technologies used:
Spring MVC,
hibernate as an ORM to connect to h2 database,
Spring Security for restricting user access to admin pages,
Used Apache Tomcat 9.0 Server as server,
Angular JS to display data from database,
Spring WebFlow for the process of registration and buy now.
